The repository to connect https://obsidianninja11.github.io to my discord account.
As far as I'm aware, you MUST verify using HTTPS, and you have to make a new repository, since it seems that github won't publish folders starting with `.` (there may be a way to bypass this that I don't know of though).

Thanks to [oyepriyansh/.well-known](https://github.com/oyepriyansh/.well-known) for letting me know to make another repository to connect my github.io domain.
